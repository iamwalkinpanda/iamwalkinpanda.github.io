## What is Artificial Intelligence?

### Foundational Concept/Benchmark -
According to Alan Turing - If the machine can have conversation with human and if the human cannot identify he is talking to a machine, then we have achieved Artifical Intelligence. Today, the focus is more on creating systems that are effective at specific tasks (like medical diagnosis or driving), not necessarily tricking a human.

### Theoritical Explanation -
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a broad field of computer science focused on building smart machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence(Perception, Reasoning, Learning, Problem-solving, Decision-making, etc). A primary approach within modern is a system that learns patterns from large amounts of data and uses statistical and mathematical methods to make predictions or decisions, without needing to try every single possibility.

### Types of AI -

* **Rule Based AI/ Symbolic AI/ Good Old-Fashioned AI (GOFAI)** - IF/ELSE condition based system.
* **Machine Learning** - Find patterns in data and improves with experience.
* **Deep Learning** - uses neural networks to model very complex relationships. This is a subfield of Machine Learning..
* **Generative AI** - trained on huge datasets to generate new content.  It's worth noting that most state-of-the-art Generative AI models are built using Deep Learning techniques.

### Use Case of AI -

* **Transcribe or translate spoken language** - [ML(NLP) - to understand context and use words, Deep Learning (using architectures like Transformers) - to handle slang and other nuance]
* **Play humans in games (Chess, Go, StarCraft)** - [Machine Learning to find patterns and Deep Learning - to use neural networks to get the complexity]
* **Driving cars, flying airplanes** - [Machine Learning to find patterns and Deep Learning - to use neural networks to get the complexity. There are also critical Rule-Based systems for safety (e.g., IF distance to object < X AND speed > Y, THEN apply brakes immediately]
* **Speech recognition and generation** - [ML(NLP) - to understand context and use words. Also Deep learning - to understand accent]
* **Suggesting code for developers** - [Rule Based AI - for syntax and ML - to find patterns, context to suggest code, GenAI - to generate new content]
* **Medical diagnositics** - [Rule Based AI - to take first pass for symptoms, ML - to find patterns, Deep Learning is essential for interpreting complex, unstructured data like medical images (X-rays, MRIs)]
* **Automating business process** - [Rule Based AI - for if/else case, ML - find pattern and improvise, GenAI - to generate new content]
*  **Fraud detection** - [Rule Based AI - for if/else case, ML - find pattern and improvise, Deep learning - solve for complex issues]

### Practical example 
Intelligent Document Processing (IDP) - Optical Character Recognition (OCR). OCR is the system that first converts the scanned image of the invoice into machine-readable text. It's a foundational step. By providing a structured invoice and feeding information like from where to get required information like seller, buyer, items, quantity, cost to an Invoice Processing System, the computer can automatically update database with scanned invoice copies. This system uses - Computer Visipn, to see the image and interpret it. Deep Learning, to identify the information required for extraction based on the input. Natural Language Process - to undertand what everything means, in order the extract the correct information. Then automate it to update to DB.
